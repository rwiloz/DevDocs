# ListExtensions Class

This class `ListExtensions` is written in C#. It is a part of the namespace `G3.Core.Utils.ListExt`. The class contains a set of extension methods for working with collections that implement the `IEnumerable<T>` interface.

## `FirstOrDefaultValue` Method

This method extends `IEnumerable<TItem>`. It attempts to retrieve the first item in the collection that matches the given predicate. If no suitable item is found, it returns a default value. The method allows applying a transformation to the selected item before it is returned.

## `ConvertAll` Method

The `ConvertAll` method also extends the `IEnumerable<T>` interface. It allows transforming all items in a collection, according to a provided converter function. The method returns a new collection containing the transformed items.

## `DistinctBy` Method

The `DistinctBy` method is another extension that applies to `IEnumerable<T>`. It allows removing duplicates from a collection, based on a key selected for each item. The method is based on a StackOverflow response [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1300088/distinct-with-lambda](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1300088/distinct-with-lambda).

## `IsNullOrEmpty` Method

This method checks if a given `IEnumerable<T>` instance is `null` or contains no elements. The method returns `true` if the collection is null or empty, otherwise `false`.

> Note: There are commented out pieces of code in this class, including a `ToHashSet` method, which converts an `IEnumerable<T>` to a `HashSet<T>` with an optional comparer.
