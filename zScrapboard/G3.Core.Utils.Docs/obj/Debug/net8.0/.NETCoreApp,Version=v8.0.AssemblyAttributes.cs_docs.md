This is a C# code snippet that provides metadata about the application's target framework. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `using System; using System.Reflection;`: These are namespaces provided by .NET that contains classes to interact with .NET types, attributes, and other metadata. Particularly, `System.Reflection` provides classes and types that provide a managed view of loaded types, methods, and fields, thus allowing code to access these details.

- `[assembly: global::System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute(".NETCoreApp,Version=v8.0", FrameworkDisplayName = ".NET 8.0")]`: is an assembly attribute. 

`global::System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute(".NETCoreApp,Version=v8.0", FrameworkDisplayName = ".NET 8.0")` specifically denotes an attribute that specifies which version of .NET is targeted by the application. In this case, it targets .NET Core version 8.0.

The `FrameworkDisplayName` property specifies the friendly name of the .NET version the application targets. In this case, the name is ".NET 8.0".

The autogenerated note on top indicates that this code file is generated automatically by a tool, and shouldn't be modified manually as changes may be overwritten by the tool.
  

This code is typically found in the 'AssemblyInfo.cs' file, which contains information about an assembly, like its version number, title, description, the company that created it, its copyright status, etc.
