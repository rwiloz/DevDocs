## Overview

> I'm currently gathing infromation from old emails etc so there wil be duplication of the same topic in multiple locations

### G3 Platform 
- Our G3 Platform is an application development platform that helps reduce deployment effort, provides speed to market and reduced risk by managing and hosting business applications
- Web applications are based on Angular and are Progressive Web Apps (PWA) that download in the browser up front and work more like traditional desktop applications (there isnâ€™t any server side web page rendering)
- The web apps use API calls to down load application data which is then rendered in the browser
- G3 provides a micro service type environment where individual services are hosted to provide the APIs
- The architecture has been designed to be cloud ready 

### Applications
We currently have about 35 applications running on the G3 Platform in Australia and UK
These are supported by about 50 services groups that include about 600 individual services
