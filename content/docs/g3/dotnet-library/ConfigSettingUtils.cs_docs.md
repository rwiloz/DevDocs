# ConfigSettingUtils Class

This class is currently commented out and has a `TODO` comment for someone named `Khoung` to work on it. 

The code file starts with a call to the System.Configuration .NET library, which provides the functionality to use configuration settings of an application.

Following, we have a namespace `G3.Core.Utils.Configurations` which includes all the code below. A namespace is used to organize your code and is collection of classes, interfaces, structs, enums and delegates.

The commented class `ConfigSettingUtils` constitutes a static utility class which might be used to wrap some of the functionality provided by the `ConfigurationManager`.

The method `GetBool` is an extension method on the `ConfigurationManager` class which is supposed to get the boolean value of a specific configuration setting. If the specific setting does not exist, it should return the provided default value. It uses the key (setting) to retrieve the app setting, converts the setting to a boolean value, and returns this value. If the setting doesn't exist, it doesn't throw an error but instead returns a default value that is passed in as a parameter.

Keep in mind, the code is currently commented out and must be uncommented to be functional. It also lacks the implementation of the `.ToBoolean(defaultValue)` method on string objects.
